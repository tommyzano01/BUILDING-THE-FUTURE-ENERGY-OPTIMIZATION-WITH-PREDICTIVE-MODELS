# BUILDING-THE-FUTURE-ENERGY-OPTIMIZATION-WITH-PREDICTIVE-MODELS
This work presents a predictive model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the heating load of residential buildings from eight design parameters. Trained with JAX and optimized with Adam, the model was validated through statistical analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and an interactive user interface.
